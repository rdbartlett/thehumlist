# The Handbook of Handbooks for Decentralised Organising

a mega list of handbooks and toolkits 
for groups working without top-down management
from social movements to workplaces
open source for anyone to read, update, share



----

üêí Hi I'm [Richard D. Bartlett](http://richdecibels.com)! I'm writing [a book about decentralised organising](https://leanpub.com/patterns-for-decentralised-organising/), finding lessons across diverse contexts, from social movements to workplaces. 

I recently [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1075525912475590656) and on [a mailing list](http://fairsay.com/networks/ecampaigning-forum) for examples of decentralised organisations that have a public, transparent, well-documented handbook that explains how they work (e.g. decision making, roles, communications tools, etc). The response was overwhelming so I've digested it into this page. 

**If you have more to add,** please [edit this page](https://hackmd.io/s/Skh_dXNbE/edit?both) or contribute [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1078822810720468992) :heart_eyes:

## Why 

I think the best structure for any organising effort must be custom-fit to its local context. I don't believe in "one size fits all" solutions, but we don't need to start from a blank slate either. [My book](https://leanpub.com/patterns-for-decentralised-organising/) is a collection of "patterns", experiences that are common in all collaborative groups. Each pattern names a common *dysfunction* (e.g. unfair distribution of care labour), and a *response* (e.g. account for care work the same way you treat other work).

My approach to organisational development: 
1. üè† understand the **local context** for this org: history, relationships, intentions, strengths, obstacles, etc.
2. üåè zoom out to a **global view** to find an appropriate frame of reference (e.g. #agile, #teal, #sociocracy, #coops, #designthinking, #artofhosting)
3. üîé zoom in to an ***adjacent* local context** (i.e. another organisation that shares something in common with this one)
4. üè° **return home** with lessons to inform the next experiment we'll try

So the "handbooks" listed here are examples of *local* context (with much gratitude to the authors who make their experience transparent for others to learn from). The "toolkits and books" are *global* lessons extracted from local experience.
